        <p class="about">
            Back in the days when I played with <span class="color">Legos</span>, I wanted to be an Architect but after I got my first computer (oh boy, my good old HP notebook) I started to be more and more hooked about <span class="color">TECHNOLOGY, PROGRAMMING, GAMES, CYBERPUNK, SCI-FI and SPACE</span> and now... we are here.
        </p>
        <p class="about" style="margin-top: 2em;">
            I find this whole world of programming/computers phenomenal, every time when you learn something, you're available to see how much more there is to learn and how little you really know. This is exactly what drives me to be super passionate about programming/computers and to become even more hard-working.
