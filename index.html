        <p class="about">
            Back in the days when I played with <span class="color">Legos</span>, I wanted to be an Architect but after I got my first computer (oh boy, my good old HP notebook) I started to be more and more hooked about <span class="color">TECHNOLOGY, PROGRAMMING, GAMES, CYBERPUNK, SCI-FI and SPACE</span> and now... we are here.

        <p class="about">
            I find this whole world of programming/computers phenomenal - it lets you to be super creative and to make art in some way or another.

            Learning about it is super addictive - every time you learn something new - there's window: which shows you how much more there is to learn and this is way I'm supper passionate about it and why I'm trying to become super hard-working person. The very thought of how complex and big this world is drives me.
