			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Tool for Spotify users, built with React, Spotify API and with backend hosted on Heroku.
			</p>

			<h2>Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Log in with Spotify.</li>
				<li>Option to display public and private playlists of user + information about them (num. of songs, name and cover art).</li>
				<li>Display 100 songs (sorted by latest or oldest) in playlist.</li>
				<li>Duplicate playlists with new number of songs, edit their title and description.</li>
				<li>Deleting playlist from library with one button click.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<p>
				After user successfully logged in with his account, we use Spotify API endpoint to GET list of all playlists of a current user and then we display information about all of them (name, num. of songs, cover art). By clicking on cover of a playlists we're redirect to subpage where more informations about that playlist are displayed + 100 (oldest or latest) songs from that playlist are displayed on that page too. By clicking 'Pare Down' button pop-up shows up where we can set up whole process of Pare Down - name of new playlist, description, privacy setting and number of songs. By clicking big and blue 'Pare Down' button on last step - new and pared down version of that playlist is created (by sending POST to Spotify API playlists endpoint).
			</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It was my first time using this type of an API, so it took me some time to fully adapt to using it. Especially when I was implementing option to sort current playlist (recently added or oldest ones) - choosing correct query parameters, then fetching and displaying correctly sorted tracks.

					When a few months passed after the creation of this project I decided to redesign the whole webpage of it. So learning more about proper design concepts, colors and all of that was quite a challenge. Also with redesign I wanted to use React Router so that was also something new for me.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Future development</h2>
			<p>
				<s>I would like to redesign the whole website</s> Now, when redesign is done I would like to add suport for my music streaming services (Apple Music and Deezer at first).
				On top of that I would like to add 'premier calendar' functionality to this project.
