			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Tool for Spotify users, built with React + Typescript,NextJS and Spotify API. With styling done by TailwindCSS and styled-components.
			</p>

			<h2>Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Log in with Spotify.</li>
				<li>Display grid of public, private and collaborative playlists on grid.</li>
				<li>Playlist details view - name, description, etc. and with a table of 25 lastly added songs to the playlist.</li>
				<li>Create pared down version of playlist. With new number of songs choosen by user, new name and description.</li>
				<li>Modal to edit playlist details.</li>
				<li>Deleting playlist from library with one button click.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<p>
				We use NextJS api routes to create our middleware REST API between our frontend and Spotify API. We use that API to retrieve private and public playlists of a user (that then are displayed on the frontend), and also to edit, delete and create new playlists for the user.
			</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It was my first time using this type of an API, so it took me some time to fully adapt to using it. Especially when I was implementing option to sort current playlist (recently added or oldest ones) - choosing correct query parameters, then fetching and displaying correctly sorted tracks.
				</li>
				<li>
					When a few months passed after the creation of this project I decided to redesign the whole webpage of it. So learning more about proper design concepts, colors and all of that was quite a challenge. Also with redesign I wanted to use React Router so that was also something new for me.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then the next redesign came, but this time we didn't only focused on the UI/UX of the app, but also on the technologies used behind the scenes. Basically the whole app was redesigned from the ground up (both the UX/UI and code for both frontend and backend), this time we used ReactJS with Typescript, with a help of NextJS and with UX/UI created by TailwindCSS and styled-components. This version of the app is the one that I'm really happy with.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Future development</h2>
			<p>
				<s>I would like to redesign the whole website</s> <s>Now, when redesign is done I would like to add suport for my music streaming services (Apple Music and Deezer at first).
				On top of that I would like to add 'premier calendar' functionality to this project</s>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm happy both with the code and the UX/UI of the app but there's always a place for some improvements, so I'm sure that this is not a final version of Pare Down.
