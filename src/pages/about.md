I'm a self-taught Software Developer from Poland, and I embarked on my programming journey in 2019. Initially, I focused solely on Frontend Web Development, but now I work on both the front-end and back-end.

The website you're currently browsing has undergone a significant transformation in 2023. It started as a basic portfolio I created at the beginning of my career. Although it maintains a minimalistic style, it represents a substantial improvement over the initial version.<br />
Additionally, I've added a [blog posts](/posts) section where I share some of my thoughts...

Or send me a message by email at <u><strong>contact</strong></u> at <u><strong>mytymon.com</strong></u>, and who knows - maybe it will be the start of something great!

## What I'm doing now
*Updated June 15th, 2023*

- **Fullstack Developer at [Growl](https://www.growl.be/)**: Working remotely as a contractor, contributing to the development of amazing applications for clients.
- **Personal Projects**: I actively maintain and develop my own personal projects. These projects serve as a creative outlet for me to experiment with new ideas and technologies. Feel free to explore my [portfolio](/projects) to see some of the exciting things I'm working on.
- **Continuous Learning**: I have a strong passion for learning, and I make it a point to acquire new knowledge and skills regularly. While my main focus is on development-related subjects, I also dedicate time to explore diverse areas of interest.
