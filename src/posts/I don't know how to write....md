title: I don't know how to write...
description: Small history of me trying to start writing, redesigns of personal projects (taking longer than supposed to), using ChatGPT for it and trying again after feeling about it.

Some time ago, I had this great idea to start writing blog posts on my personal website.

So, while I was at it, I did a whole website redesign, twice - because I didn't like the first version. Overall, the whole process took way longer than I thought it would, and more than it should... (**it's always like that, that's why some people just don't bother touching their old projects**).

And finally, after the redesign was done... the time for writing had come. 

But there was one small problem - **I had no idea what to write about**.

So even more time has passed, and I finally came up with an idea of what to write about.

This post is no longer here, but I can say that the main idea behind it was this: "Why React Native sucks" because as everybody knows, **it's super easy to be a hater... even when there's some truth behind it**.

After a while, after working on some other stuff and going back to React Native, I had a completely new opinion about it - it wasn't so bad. But at the same time, I knew that on my website, I had a post why it sucks so it didn't look good at all to have that negative opinion about it and at the same time use it. So I decided to write a second post, why it isn't so bad actually.

**Then, 6 months passed, and I didn't think about writing something new...**

But my lack of new ideas was just one issue. **The second issue - which I think was a bigger one for me, even when I've tried to dismiss it, was the fact that I've used ChatGPT to almost completely rewrite the draft for both of these blog posts**.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with using these new tools that we have now at our fingertips, but using them almost exclusively for a blog post? I think that's just a bad look.

**I don't want a world where everything on the internet is created by bots and language models.** 

Unfortunately, with every passing day, we are coming closer to it...

At least I can contribute to **being "the change in the world" by simply not writing posts like that.**

So what you see here is my second attempt at having my personal blog. I know it's no longer the early 2000s when this was really popular, but let me have my own go at it.

**Just like when I tried to write "books" when I was 8 years old.**

**I feel like most of us have this urge to write something and send it to the world. Some have it early, and others later in life...**

*Promise, this time I've written this blog post by myself and no LLMs were ~~harmed~~ used to help with it. ðŸ¤ž*{.small-secondary}
