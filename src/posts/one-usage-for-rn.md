title: Maybe I was wrong, here is where React Native can shine

Okay, maybe **I was a little bit too harsh on React Native** in my initial blog post about it. Don't get me wrong; I think it's a great piece of technology/framework. However, at the time of writing that article, I guess I was just venting my frustration. At times, it was really frustrating for me to use. But now, my opinion about RN may have changed a little bit, and I may have **come up with a use case where it can truly shine**.

## React Native's Potential for MVPs
Imagine this situation:
- **You have an idea for an app, and you're considering starting a startup**
- You start researching the first steps for launching a business
- One of the recommended steps is to research the market, which you can do in two ways: creating an MVP for customers/investors to see and use or conducting a survey
- You decide on the first way, but you learn that **starting a business without thoroughly researching the market isn't advisable**. Therefore, the MVP you want to build should be ready fairly quickly
- Now, you find yourself stuck in this situation where you want to create an MVP to test your idea, but simultaneously, you shouldn't invest too much time without researching the market thoroughly

This is where I believe **React Native can be incredibly helpful: for quickly building an MVP for an idea**, especially in a situation where someone is more familiar with React/Front-end development than with Kotlin/mobile app development. Moreover, it's quite possible that finding someone with an RN development background for such a project might be easier than finding someone with Kotlin/Swift expertise. Additionally, when targeting both platforms, **using React Native rather than developing separate Android and iOS apps** could be a more streamlined approach.

Of course, there are downsides to this idea, given that it's still React Native:
- If you lack knowledge of React Native but have experience with Kotlin/Swift, this approach might take longer
- Transitioning from using one technology for MVP to a different one (or two, for both platforms) could be time-consuming and costly. Some argue that this problem is more manageable when the business is successful and starting with it initially might be cheaper
- The MVP might not look and function as perfectly as desired, given React Native's nature
- While using RN might seem faster due to familiarity compared to learning Kotlin, there might be cases where implementing certain features could be more complex than with native development
- And probably more aspects to discover as you delve into the process of creating the MVP
