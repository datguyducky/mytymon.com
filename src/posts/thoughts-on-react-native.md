title: Duct-tape artists using JS to make apps - my thoughts on React Native

Remember all those articles hyping up React Native, claiming that big companies were rushing to it because it offered _performance comparable to native apps, lightning-fast development, and easy multi-platform compatibility_? Yeah, I remember too. But guess what? Now we're seeing articles left and right about companies ditching React Native and going back to native development for their apps.

Seems like the world has finally woken up from the React Native nightmare. Developers are no longer interested in being **"duct-tape artists" forced to use JavaScript for app development**. Sure, the idea of using JavaScript for mobile apps sounded fantastic, but let's face it, it didn't work out as great as we thought.

And hey, you're probably wondering, _"Who the heck is this guy?"_ Well, I'll be honest with you - I'm just a regular dude who tried React Native for my own hobby project, and boy, did I hate the experience. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad, but **the more I worked with RN, the stronger my desire grew to learn Kotlin/Swift**.
Sure, I didn't work on some big fancy app with a massive team or thousands of users. But if someone like me struggled to make React Native work for a small hobby project, how can we expect it to handle more sophisticated systems where performance, complexity, and advanced functionalities are crucial? It's a valid concern. **React Native can feel limiting and frustrating when you're pushing the boundaries of what you can accomplish**.

Now, don't get me wrong. React Native isn't completely useless. It's possible to implement more advanced features and it's not the worst in terms of performance. It's just that you end up feeling "dirty" using it, constantly applying weird workarounds to achieve even a fraction of what you originally wanted. It shouldn't be like that, especially when you're limited by Facebook's and Expo's vision for React Native. It's just not worth the hassle.

So, for me, **the bottom line is clear: React Native isn't the way to go. Native app development is where it's at.**
