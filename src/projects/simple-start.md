A long time ago, I made the decision to switch my daily browser from Opera to Firefox, primarily for privacy reasons. 
While Mozilla had created a truly remarkable browser, there was one feature I missed from Opera - the new tab page.

During that period, Firefox didn't have a built-in new tab or home page, and the available options for download on the Add-ons store didn't suit my preferences. 
That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and create one myself.

## At first...
If I'm not mistaken, this is my second major project that I've worked on, with the first being the [Diceware Generator](/projects/diceware-generator).
The initial released version of this project clearly had room for improvement in terms of its appearance and functionality.

Since I'm writing this article long after the project's creation, I don't quite recall the specific issues and thoughts I had about it back then. 
However, here is a screenshot that reflects how it appeared at that time:

## The big redesign
Since I use this project on a daily basis, I chose it to serve as my 'playground' to apply what I've learned after working as a professional developer for two years. With this in mind, I decided to start this redesign, focussing on the following aspects:
- The utmost importance was placed on the code quality, aiming for cleanliness and maintainability.
- Addressing the previous subpar design, I aimed to create the UX/UI as good as the code itself.
- Typescript, Typescript everywhere...
- Comments - better structured and used more frequently.
- To test new tools that I've learned in last two years: Vite and Mantine.
- Minimize the usage of npm dependencies as much as possible.

Please note that as I write this article some time after the redesign, I do not recall the specific challenges and thoughts I encountered during the process. However, here is the current appearance of the project:

<img src="/public/simplestart_new.png" width="720" class="img-border" />

## Future plans
As mentioned above, this is a project that I use basically every day, and for that reason, I think it's the best project on which I can work.
So every so often, I will come back to it to review what I've learned in the last couple of months or years as a developer.

And, of course, there are still a lot of ideas and things that I can add or improve in Simple Start.
